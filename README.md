# DGM-Advection-AD
Spectral Element Method -> Discontinuous Galerkin Method to solve the advection equation with adaptive element splititng. (NP-adaptive, Faster)

Using elements of Kopriva's DGM code and Mavriplis' error estimator.

Files: Discontinuous_SEM_NP_Adaptive_Advection.py -> Main Linear_regression.py -> Used to fit the spectra to determine need to split. MeshGenerator.py -> Generates 1D mesh

Libraries required: Numpy - Linear Algebra operations + array structures. Matplotlib - Plotting

Additional libraries: TQDM - Progress bar
